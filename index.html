        <h3>Exploring Places</h3>
        <p>
            There are plenty of things one can gain from exploring different places. The list includes gaining new friends, new experiences, and new stories.
            When you start exploring new places, you get a better understanding of the people living there, including their culture, history and background.
            Studies show that travelling can improve your overall health and <b>enhance your creativity.</b> 
            Therefore, you need to take time out from your daily tasks, office <b>responsibilities, hectic schedule, </b> everyday pressures at least once in a year.
